Unlike nearly every other free college baseball analytics site, UVA Stats supports advanced filtering that enables fans and coaches to find the insights that matter. Check how players' performances change over the course of the season, or identify the specific factors that contribute to their success.

* **Real-Time Updates:** A custom scraping system updates the database with the latest advanced stats immediately following each game.
* **Completely Free:** All data and analysis are provided without paywalls, making advanced stats accessible to everyone.
* **Upcoming Features:** Detailed stat splits for batting and pitching are coming soon!
